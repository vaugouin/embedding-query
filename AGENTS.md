# AGENTS.md - Agent Guide for Embedding Query

This file gives you the agentic context you need to work on this codebase safely. For project overview, features, install / deploy steps and human-facing security / performance / troubleshooting material, read @README.md — that file is canonical and not duplicated here.

This is the single canonical guide for autonomous coding agents in this repository. Assistant-specific files such as @CLAUDE.md, and any future tool-specific guide such as `GEMINI.md`, should only point here and should not duplicate repository instructions.

Deeper specs live in their own files:

- For any project update, keep documentation aligned:
  - Update `README.md` for user-facing behavior, configuration, setup, deployment, troubleshooting, or verification changes.
  - Update this file only when agent workflow or safety context changes.

## Where things live (file → role)

Edit at the right layer; the architecture is intentionally split.

## Code conventions

- **Hungarian notation** for variables (legacy style):
  - `str` — strings (`strtablename`, `strapiversion`)
  - `lng` — integers (`lngpage`, `lngrowsperpage`)
  - `dbl` — floats (`dblavailableram`)
  - `arr` — lists / arrays
  - `int` — boolean-like flags (`intcleanupenabled`, `intentity`)
- **Function naming**: public pipeline entry points use `f_` (`f_text2sql`, `f_entity_extraction`, `f_resolve_complex_question`, `f_answer_single_value`, `f_hello_world`); private helpers use `_` (`_call_chat_llm`, `_normalize_llm_model`).
- **Docstrings**: Google-style on public functions.
- **Error handling**: broad try/except with console logging; surface failures via the `error` response field and the `messages` trace. Database execution errors are not returned directly to clients — they go through the complex-question retry path when enabled.
- **JSON serialization**: use `logs.decimal_serializer()` for `Decimal` and `datetime`.

## Encoding

Keep Markdown, prompt files, JSON config, and logs UTF-8. These files contain non-ASCII names and multilingual examples. Avoid editor or terminal operations that rewrite them with mojibake.
